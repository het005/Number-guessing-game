# Number-guessing-game
A simple terminal-based Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player reach the correct answer. The game also tracks the number of attempts.

# Features

1. Random number generation using Python's random module.

2. Unlimited guessing until the correct number is found.

3. User-friendly feedback after each guess.

4. Input validation to prevent crashes from invalid input.

5. Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
